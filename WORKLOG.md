- 2026-01-13 Done: Added series/forecast diagnostics to log min/max, negatives, and missing values in generation data and forecasts.
- 2026-01-13 Doing: Investigating why ERCO_WND forecasts go negative by tracing data and model outputs with the new diagnostics.
- 2026-01-13 Next: Run the pipeline with diagnostics on real ERCO_WND data and capture any negative rows in training/forecast outputs.
